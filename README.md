# Portfolio
    This site is intended as a personal portfolio.

### To do
- [x] Set up email address
- [ ] Move javascript:onload call to functions.js by means of jQuery
- [ ] Set up proper project viewer on index
- [ ] Ensure some level of support for users who do not have js enabled or are using old/text based browsers
- [ ] Change color scheme slightly (black & white should be less harsh in dark mode, and all link coloring should be switched around as blue on black doesn't show up.)
- [ ] Add mobile support
- [ ] Change how image and text sizes scale on larger displays
